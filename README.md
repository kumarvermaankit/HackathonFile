Problem Statement

India is one of the biggest importers of various goods and materials from other countries, also there is a huge shortage of jobs as well, both of these problems are somehow related to one thing:-
In India, there is a huge communication gap between local and small suppliers, with other service recipients of various products such as electronic parts & equipment, toys, plastic products, firecrackers etc , and services such as logistics, repairing, delivery, security, etc. For other "TENDER" related works, we generally use Indian government websites where the process is way too tedious to do.
Big companies and foreign countries like china and japan use this communication gap to create a monopoly in the market by eliminating other small competitors. 
 
Solution Description

To address the above we have MIDDLEMAN, an outsourcing platform of various products and services for MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) from small vendors and various other MSME. Here you can
1). Post requirements of goods or products along with the price range, quantity, delivery date, and various other details.
2). Post requirements of services with the salary, qualification, job description, timings, etc.
3). List any goods or services one can provide.
4). Apply for various government and private tenders related to big tasks
5). Apply for any service in collaboration with other providers of the same service.
The last point can be elaborated as, if one supplier can supply only 40% in quantity of one tender and other 2 can supply for 30% each, they can have a discussion over price and various other factors in the chatbox, thus they can fill that tender in collaboration with each other, which will increase one’s chance of getting an order.
